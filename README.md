# CST115 Final Project - Vending Machine

#### Program:
Vending Machine
#### Authors:
Ronald Pearl, Aaron Fonseca, Kris Hayes
#### Summary:
Final Project for CST-115 class
#### Date:
8/8/16 - 9/25/16
#### Description:
The vending machine will have two types of users â€“ a customer, who will be able to select a product, and a BOSS, who will be able to maintain the collection of products in the machine.  The machine itself will have a graphical interface that displays the available products and allows the user to make selections.  The BOSS will have a separate interface that provides a variety of maintenance options.  The machine will provide a means of alternating between the two types of users.

## Milestone 1

1. Sketch a storyboard of end product that shows the flow of the application (e.g., user input, application output).

2. Design a class using UML that models a product one might find in a snack machine. Submit UML for their product class. Submit a document with your UML.

3. Design a class using UML that models a dispenser of products. Students should submit UML for their dispenser class. Submit your UML as a document. 

## Files

Storyboard is located in the Storyboard folder.
Product and Dispenser classes and their UMLs are in the Final_Project package.
